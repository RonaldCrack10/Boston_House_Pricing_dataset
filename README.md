# Boston Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts house prices in Boston using the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing) from Kaggle. It uses machine learning models to analyze features like crime rate, number of rooms, and tax rates to estimate house prices.

## Dataset
- Download the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing) (`housing.csv`) from Kaggle.
- Place it in the `data/` folder.
- **Note**: The dataset is not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Place `housing.csv` here (not uploaded).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration (`exploration.ipynb`) and training (`model_training.ipynb`).
- `src/`: Scripts for preprocessing (`preprocessing.py`) and modeling (`model.py`).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `jupyter` (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
